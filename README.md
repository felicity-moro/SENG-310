# SENG-310

This course focused on a single project/prototype for the entirety of the course. My team designed SpendSavvy, a finance/budgeting mobile app targeted at users newer to managing their funds.
The final project, a medium fidelity prototype containting only key features, was designed, created, and evaluated.
